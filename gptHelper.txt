I prefer readability.
I like each calculation to have their own val/ def / line of code, if possible.
Meaning to use intermediate variables:
So returned tuples should for example be:
NextElement =...
NextState =...
(NextElement, NextState)

I prefer clearly named variables, such as countOfStudents instead of 'n'

I have different rankings of how much the teacher likes different coding styles:
BEST:
variables using val
value bindings
expression values
parametric polymorphism
Composed dedicated higher order functions
Using dedicated API if possible such as State
Options or Either monad

MIDDLE:
simple recursion.
folds
if condition / pattern matching 

WORST:
variables using var
Return statement
any/object type
loops
exceptions
