/* Final Exam: Advanced Programming, by Andrzej WÄ…sowski
 * IT University of Copenhagen, Autumn 2023: 05 January 2024
 *
 * The exam consists of 9 questions to be solved within 4 hours.
 * Solve the tasks in the file 'Exam.scala' (this file).
 *
 * You can use all functions provided in the included files,  as well
 * as functions we implemented in the course (if the source is missing
 * in this folder, you can add it to this file, so that things compile)
 *
 * You can access any static written aids, also online, but you are
 * not allowed to communicate with anybody or with anything (bots).
 * Using GitHub copilot ChatGPT and similar large language models
 * during the exam is not allowed. By submitting you legally declare to
 * have solved the problems alone, without communicating with anybody.
 *
 * Do not modify this file in other ways than answering the questions
 * (adding imports is allowed). Do not reorder the answers, and do not
 * remove question numbers or comments from the file. 
 *
 * Submit this file and only this file to LearnIT. Do not convert to
 * any other format than .scala. Do not submit the entire zip archive.
 * The only accepted file format is '.scala'.
 *
 * Keep the solutions within 80 columns width to make grading easier.
 *
 * The answers will be graded manually. We focus on the correctness of
 * ideas, the use of concepts, clarity, and style. We will use
 * undisclosed automatic tests during grading, but not to compute the
 * final grade, but to help us debug your code.
 *
 * We do require that the file compiles.  The directory has a project
 * setup so compilation with scala-cli shall work out-of-the-box.
 * If you cannot make a fragment compile, put your solution in a
 * comment, next to the three question marks. We will grade the
 * solutions in comments as well.
 *
 * Files that do not compile will automatically fail the exam. 
 *
 * The size of the exam has been adjusted from previous years so that
 * you have time to work with the compiler. We do not recommend to run
 * and test the code if you are pressed for time. It is a good idea to
 * run and test, if you have time. 
 *
 * Good luck! */
